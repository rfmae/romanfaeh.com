# Roman Faeh's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## About

I'm Roman Faeh, a security engineer based in Switzerland. This site is my personal home on the web — a place for writing, notes, and blog posts about security, AI, LLM systems, and practical engineering.
